    Welcome to my GitHub website. The objective of this website is to share
    information about the projects that I am working on, share random code
    samples that I have been inspired to create for one reason or another, or
    to dive deep into technical topics that I am interested in. Please feel
    free to look around, play with the code samples, and contribute in any
    way that you see fit. In my work as a professional software developer,
    I generate a lot of code on most days and hopefully some of it will be
    of interest to you and help you out in your own projects.

                        I will be attending Startup Weekend in Phoenix. If you have never done a Startup Weekend, this is a great event. Over a 54 hour time period, you can team up with others on the next great idea. The concept of the event is to drive to a minimum viable product, and maybe, just maybe, create a new startup company.
