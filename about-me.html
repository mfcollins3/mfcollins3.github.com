            <p>
                I currently work for <a href="http://www.neudesic.com">Neudesic</a>
                as an architect for the Neudesic Product Development team. I joined
                Neudesic in May, 2008, as a principal consultant in the Phoenix
                office. I became Practice Director for Custom Application Development
                in 2009. I transferred into my current role in November, 2011.

                Prior to joining Neudesic, I worked for the following companies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sogeti, USA</strong> - Phoenix, AZ</li>

                <h1>Where did I go to School?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                I originally attended California State University, Sacramento,
                immediately after graduating from Dixon High School in Dixon,
                CA. I studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science from
                1993-1996. I left Sac State after the end of the 1996 semester
                because the company that I was working for (Healthcare
                Information Services) had been acquired by Lippincott-Raven
                Publishers and was being relocated to Philadelphia, PA. As I
                needed to work more than finish my degree, I relocated to the
                San Francisco Bay Area to continue my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the years since leaving Sac State, I continued my education
                by taking courses at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, CA,
                and Rio Salado College in Tempe, AZ.

                <h1>What Languages do I Know/Use?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                I know how to write programs in several languages. Some languages
                I still know, such as Assembly Language, even though I use it
                less frequently as time goes by. For my professional career, I
                primarily program in C# and .NET, but I am starting to diversify
                into other technologies such as Node.js as well. Here is a list
                of the programming languages that I am using currently or have
                used in past projects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>VB.NET/Visual Basic</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Objective-C</li>
                <li>JavaScript (browser)</li>
                <li>Node.js/JavaScript</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>Erlang</li>
                <li>Perl</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Scala</li>
                <li>Clojure</li>
                <li>Intel x86 Assembly Language</li>
                <li>Pascal</li>
                <li>Prolog</li>
                <li>COBOL</li>

            <p>
                One of the things that I enjoy the most about my current job
                is the interaction with the community that I have been able to
                do. I enjoy presenting at user groups and code camps. In the
                past, I have presented at the following user groups or events:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Desert Code Camp</li>
                <li>SQL Saturday</li>
                <li>Phoenix Mobile Festival</li>
                <li>Phoenix Connected Systems User Group</li>
                <li>Phoenix Azure User Group</li>
                <li>Northwest Valley .NET User Group</li>
                <li>Phoenix SQL Server User Group</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h3>Contact me</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoy interacting and sharing ideas with others who have similar
            interests. You can reach me through the following means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email: <a href="michael@imaginaryrealities.com">michael@imaginaryrealities.com</a></li>
            <li>Email: <a href="michael.collins@neudesic.com">michael.collins@neudesic.com</a></li>
            <li>Telephone: <a href="tel:6232975498">623-297-5498</a></li>
            <li>Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/mfcollins3">@mfcollins3</a></li>
            <li>Skype: <a href="skype:mfcollins3">mfcollins3</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>I have a job opportunity. Can I contact you about it?</h5>
        <p>
            I am very happy and content with my current opportunity, but as a
            career-minded individual I am always open to listening. I would
            probably not be interested in a lateral move at the present time,
            but would consider leadership roles such as manager or director-level
            positions.
